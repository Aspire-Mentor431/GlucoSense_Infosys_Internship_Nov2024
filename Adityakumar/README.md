## Project Overview
Project_Diabetes aims to build a machine-learning model to predict the risk of diabetes based on healthcare data, with a focus on how lifestyle factors influence the likelihood of developing the condition. The project begins by collecting and preprocessing relevant data, ensuring it is clean and structured for analysis. Through exploratory data analysis, the team will identify key patterns and relationships in variables such as age, diet, exercise habits, and medical history. Feature engineering will be used to create new variables like BMI and select the most important features for model training. Several machine-learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, will be tested to find the best predictive model, with evaluation metrics like AUC-ROC and accuracy guiding model performance. Insights will be drawn from the model to suggest lifestyle changes that could help reduce diabetes risk. Finally, the model will be deployed for real-time predictions, with a system for continuous feedback and improvement.

## Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data discrepancies, and outlier management.
Feature Engineering: Identifying key features and relationships within the data to enhance model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing and evaluating various algorithms, including classification models, to predict diabetes risk.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, and classification accuracy.
